# Overview of the Project


I have successfully completed Mini Task 1 at my web development internship with CodTech IT Solutions. As part of this task, I developed an enhanced weather forecast web app. While it's a basic project, I added several features that significantly boosted my learning, especially in backend development.

Here are some highlights: 🌤️ Future weather prediction based on search data 💻 A visually appealing and responsive design for a great user experience 📧 Daily email updates on weather forecasts for any city or state you choose
